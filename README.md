# 200-Top-Enginneering-College


The data set was taken from college where
someone downloaded the data set from official website run by National institutional
Ranking Framework. The data set contains top 200 engineering colleges of India
and ranks based on the research, graduation outcome, outreach inclusivity,teaching resource
material, perception of the peer group about colleges etc.

We have taken an effort to visualise the data and completed the descriptive 
as well as inferential analysis using hypothesis testing. In the hypothesis testing
annova, shapiro, kruskal etc tests were applied in the project and their results are 
stated.  The interest has been put to find how the ranking of private or public colleges vary
. The steps were taken to categorise the college name into three category like IIT, NIT
and others. Further the data was analysed based on this.


Conclusion

The data contains 45% private engineering colleges and 55% government colleges

Out of these 15% are the IIT engineering colleges and 14% NIT that contribute to 
the 200 top engineering college of India

Most of the colleges tat are coming at the top contains grade AAAA, there is no A grade
college that lies in the top 200 engineering colleges

With the correlation matrix , it is observed that most the rating are correlated
with each other. For example peer perception about college is positively correlated the 
research practices of the college. Similarly, outreach inclusivity (oi) is linked with
Teaching learning Resource  (TLR)

With the box plot , it is observed that government colleges are most likely to perform better
in all performance criteria like TLR, oi, RPC, perc, go etc.

Shapiro test confirms that the for oi and go was normally distributed while rest of the
numerical features did not follow normal distribution.

Using hypothesis tests we make some relevant remarks like 
1. graduation outcome are better in government college compare to private college
2. Outreach inclusivity is not affected by the ownership of colleges
3. Grading impacts the total rating , higher grading leads to good total rating of the college
4. Ownership of the college impacts the total rating.  
Government colleges likely to provide good research practices, learning and teaching
and good perception about the college in peer groups.
